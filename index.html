                    <p>
                        If I had to put my character into just one word, that word would be <span class="ital">motivated</span>.<br>
                        Motivated to: <span class="ital">help others</span>, to <span class="ital">understand the world</span>, to <span class="ital">achieve success</span>, and to <span class="ital">unite through love</span>.<br>
                        The only problem I've run into is that there are so many ways to express these motivations.<br>
                        The key, I've learned, is to adopt a loving disposition while planning for success:<br>
                        a plan which looks a lot like learning, and helping others learn.<br><br>
                        I'm currently pursuing a Master's degree in Computational Linguistics at Indiana University Bloomington.<br>
                        My proximate goal is to learn from some very intelligent people, and to use what I learn to make my own academic contributions.<br>
                        Further down the line, I'd like to gain industry experience and pursue a Ph.D.<br><br>
                        <span class="bold">My current areas of academic interest include:</span><br>
                        <span class="ital">Bridging logic, philosophy, and computation to model action, agency, and intentionality</span><br>

                            Carrying on the work I started in my Bachelor’s, which includes a paper on
                            <a href="./assets/Symmetry Theory of Verification.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="ital">Analytical Philosophy</a>
                            and
                            <a href="./assets/Toward a Unified Theory of Action.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="ital">Action Theory</a>,
                            I am currently writing a book which models action as a scope of modal potential within which an agent (or player) moves discretely within an atomic game. I attempt to show how action as we know it is grounded metaphorically in the very basal empirical studies of physics and evolution, mediated by Information Theory and Computation. Viewed as merely a complex scalar of a more microscopic game, rationality extends the same logic employed by agents with a much more limited modal scope, resulting in confusion around how to frame action at various levels of analysis.

                        <p>
                            This book will attempt to weave these disparately scoped strands of research into a wholistic interface capable of reconciling the various solutions to the Problem of Action, or as Frankfurt put it in his 1978 paper by the same name: “...[how to] explicate the contrast between what an agent does and what merely happens to him.” To do so, I evoke Anscombe’s <span class="ital">Intention</span>, formalizing a <span class="ital">Counterfactual Substitution Test</span> and <span class="ital">Intentionality Index</span> that will ideally mediate both the metaphysical and intuitional aspects of Action Theory.

                            I believe one of the most efficacious ways to study the structure and meaning of language is to examine how it changes—both in patternistic ways and as derivative examples. In the current age, there is no more abundant landscape for discovering language mutations than the internet. The question which I originally posed in a Bachelor’s research project on
                            <a href="./assets/Examining Mutation Boundaries in Internet Language Through the Lens of Complexity Minimization.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="ital">The Interpretability of Internet Language</a>
                            was this: what features would be relevant to track such that, if properly labeled, could be used to train a supervised model capable of predicting which novel terminologies would “catch on”, or to what degree they would be interpretable. Moving forward, I plan to conduct the study proposed in the final chapter.

                            I have been writing creatively for over a decade. My published work spans the literary genres of poetry (<a href="./assets/Caught in a Webb.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="ital">Caught in a Webb</a>, <a href="./assets/Genesis.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="ital">Genesis</a>, <a href="./assets/Instagram.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="ital">Instagram</a>), including Chinese poetry (<a href="./assets/三首诗 - 3 Poems for Submission.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="ital">新眼同途</a>), as well as Science Fiction short stories which are accessible <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/weatherswriting/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">on my Subreddit</a>.

                            I chose the alias “Nick Weathers” and the subsequent publishing moniker “Weathers Writing” on a whim, and it became instantiated after working with a friend to develop a logo that I really liked. My pièce de résistance is a novel called <span class="ital">The City</span> which has been many years in the making, and likely will be many more (not to worry, as you can see, I have many other projects to keep me occupied in the meantime!). I also have a Weathers Writing Instagram, although there is currently no content posted.

                            One of the primary reasons I wanted to learn computer science was to bridge the practical gap between language teaching and language learning. One glance at my resume and you’d find a whole lot of teaching and tutoring work, which isn’t an accident. I love helping others learn, especially with regard to language. In terms of learning, I’ve been studying Chinese for over seven years now, and I’ve found that the number of exceptional online resources is low. Therefore, I wanted to develop my programming literacy to the point where I’d be able to create dynamic web applications, mini-games, and text-based learning modules capable of driving learner engagement and proficiency in a way that other softwares don’t.

                        <p>
                            My more immediate projects are based around simple image and word generator tools which can be mixed-and-matched, sentence builders, and a more involved racing game. While the work for these is still in its infancy, you can view my progress as I push commits to my <a href="https://github.com/Mgalindo15" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Github</a>. Longer-term, I want to bake in AI in such a way that can tune generative materials (including in-game activities) to user-specific proficiencies. I feel that context-specific approaches like this will become common across many fields over the coming years.

                            In addition to the projects mentioned above, I also have an interest in Computer Vision and web-games more broadly.

I also love hanging out and playing games with my friends and family.
